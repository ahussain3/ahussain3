                    <p>&ldquo;Impact&rdquo; is the word I am struggling with. There are 7 billion people in the world. If you met a new person every minute, you would have to live to 13,000 years before you reached everyone. If Katy Perry spent one minute with each person who watched her &lsquo;Dark Horse&rsquo; video on YouTube, it would take her 121 years. Find a random stranger on Facebook and look through a few of their photos&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;you will quickly see that your life, for all its pedestaled glory, is not especially special. Everyone has a beach photo, a mountain top picture, an awkward selfie. There are likely thousands of lives that exhibit little discernible difference from yours.</p>

<p>It is likely that many people will live lives that have very little outside of purely local impact. Many people will die and be completely forgotten, even by their descendants, in the snap of a finger.</p>

<p>And yet we are regularly told&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;as Harvard students&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;that we are unique, that we are special, that we might have global impact.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is incredibly difficult to leave Israel without an intestine-twisting desire to do more. To help more, to speak more, to have more impact.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for me has been in knowing how to help. There are a hundred different things I could be doing right now&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;some of them will lead me towards becoming someone who has broad-impact, and others will push me closer to becoming a forgotten face within the huddled masses.</p>

<p>If your best friend is trapped in a house fire, perhaps the worst thing you can do is go in to &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; her with just the shirt on your back. Instead you should go seek help, find water, get firefighters, find resources. If a nazi battalion is making a mass grave in your town square, perhaps the worst thing you can do is &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; to the leader. Instead you ought to take shelter, hide, and preserve yourself as best as is possible.</p>

<p>I am learning that&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;counterintuitively&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;sometimes the best way to help people is to run away. And it is in these acts of silent heroism I find myself muddled. Heroism where there is no fanfare and no Hollywood soundtrack to alert the viewer as to what is happening. People who grind away in quietness, almost selfishly, but in ways that will ripple through to the lives of many in due time.</p>

<p>Understand the apprehension. When there is no fanfare, it is easy to convince yourself that what do are doing is worthless. It is easy to believe that you ought to be doing something other. When there is no visible need to try your best, when there is no armed soldier around the corner, or suicide bomber two blocks down, it can be difficult to understand &lsquo;why?&rsquo; you must do anything at all. In such situations, I&rsquo;ve found that many people resort to the tried and tested answer that has worked so well in the past: &ldquo;Because someone told me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the trip to Israel, I will need to teach myself that when I am sat at my desk, grinding out a paper two weeks before it is due&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;I am helping someone else. When I am ploughing through despite struggling to see the relevance of a question about quantum tunnelling to the real issues of my life&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;I am helping someone else. When I take the time to organize my desk and organize my life&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;I am helping someone else. And likewise, when I shy away from challenge, or give in to weakness, it is not just that I am cheating myself, but I am also forsaking all those who would potentially be affected by my future actions.</p>

<p>I think this is what &lsquo;privilege&rsquo; means, and Harvard privilege in particular. We are all very fortunate to be here. We must try not for our own sake, not so that we may graduate to the next hoop and the next, but rather for the sake of all those who could potentially reap benefit from the opportunities that we have been fortunate enough to receive.</p>
