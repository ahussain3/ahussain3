                    <p>I dream enormous, like a dinosaur caught between <br />
a growth spurt and a paint explosion, <br />
feeding on amazonian rainforest and extra terrestrial space rock,</p>

<p>I dream enormous, like tall trees taken, turned upside down<br />
then dipped, no, sprinkled in swirling seas like tea leaves.</p>

<p>I dream enormous, like a chorus of winged horses, <br />
or neighing tortoises laying Easter eggs in Everest's scribbled crevices, </p>

<p>I dream the Earth is a smooth marble, I can twist, throw, tangle <br />
and send spinning into twin gods, Jupiter and Saturn, <br />
smashing each into chocolate chunk pieces,</p>

<p>I imagine myself spinning, swirling, soaking wet but warm, <br />
inside a teacup in the calm that precedes the storm.<br />
I imagine Armageddon will be here in three days, <br />
and I shall send him on. <br />
I imagine I will then take a nap. </p>

<p>I am older now, so I imagine the spring cleaning <br />
that will result from all this mess-making,</p>

<p>I dream of scooping space rocks back into cereal bowls,<br />
scrubbing dinosaur scales, like giant beached whales, <br />
clean, and dipped back into tea-stained watering holes,</p>

<p>I dream of apologizing. I didn't mean to put gum in your hair,<br />
but we were out of marbles. I'll spare you the details, <br />
but when sea shells cascade from the sky, <br />
when trees fell, as if uprooted by, a single breath of poetry, <br />
you act on instinct like insects in an insect society,</p>

<p>I wished to read, I wish to write, but when I sit down with a book to leaf through <br />
I turn stacks of crumpled paper into mountainsides, <br />
Complete with scree slopes, perilous ridges, designed with danger signs in mind,<br />
I wished to fly, so I found a chocolate loving unicorn, <br />
and fed him chunks of chocolate, one piece at a time.</p>
