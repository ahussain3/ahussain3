                    <p>We live in the age of information!<br />
Any question you have, answered in an instant!<br />
Anything you need is just a search away, </p>

<p>Google: How tall is mount everest<br />
Google: How do refrigerators work?<br />
Google: Why do birds fly south for the winter?</p>

<p>We used to carve words into stone blocks with latin tongues, <br />
Knowledge for the ages, knowledge for the elite,</p>

<p>Cramped in cubicle man caves,<br />
We used to paint, with ground up earth, and ground in pigment<br />
Wisdom for the ages, wisdom for the masses.</p>

<p>They used to say show me your friends and I will tell you who you are.</p>

<p>Google: How many liters are there in a gallon?<br />
Google: What is the best way to clip a parrots wings?<br />
Google: What is the quickest route to heaven?</p>

<p>When Leonardo wished to learn about the world, <br />
He found carcasses, <br />
He drew lungs, drew atria and ventricles, <br />
snooped bones, drew blood,<br />
When I wished to learn about the world, <br />
I drag my carcass to a dorm room desk, <br />
and snap my head into head into a textbook,</p>

<p>Google: Show me Leonardo's sketchbooks.<br />
Google, what color should I paint my cave?<br />
Magnolia, so the shadows stand out.</p>

<p>Some of the most useful knowledge I have ever learned has come directly out of people's mouths, into my ears, <br />
a vast interconnected network of nodes. Atom, hitting atom, hitting eardrum making sound. </p>

<p>We kept friends close.</p>

<p>Google: How did cave men live?<br />
Google: What happens if I don't get this job?<br />
Google: Am I visionary, or just stir crazy?</p>

<p>You are the knowledge you have access to.<br />
So what of the inner city kid who knows only rock star and rock bottom.<br />
We train typing fingers but what happened to train sets and tinkerers</p>

<p>Google: What should I have done differently?<br />
Google: My paper is still not written and it is due in 2 hours!<br />
Google: Why weren't you there?</p>

<p>Just cos you reddit, don't mean you've read shit,<br />
No one ever learned virtue from VICE,<br />
and getting stung a couple times don't make you buzz feed.</p>
