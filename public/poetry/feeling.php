                    <p>How are you feeling?<br />
Tired. All the time.<br />
I came to you with a physical illness,<br />
Probably something that ends in sclerosis,<br />
My hands keep hurting, and my throats constricted,<br />
My fingers keep falling off and my head's lopsided, <br />
And how do you explain this protruding vein in my left eyelid,<br />
I came here today with a physical illness, and yet you keep talking to me bout this mental &#8230;</p>

<p>How are you sleeping?<br />
I sleep standing up in case I dream I'm free falling, <br />
so I can wake up in time to catch myself,<br />
I make my heart skip a beat and then use it to tell time, <br />
And it's been ticking at a god awful rate,<br />
I'll drop a hammer and feather from a leaning tower,<br />
And if you're nice to me I might let you select which one to sit under.</p>

<p>How is your social life?<br />
I answer emails with text messages, <br />
Phone calls with retweets,<br />
Snap chat pictures of hand written letters,<br />
For you to listen to the next time that we meet in person<br />
See, I'm usually not so shy to begin communicating but, <br />
Your social awkwardness makes you a little intimidating,</p>

<p>Have you been getting out of the house?<br />
I know I'm flying, <br />
But I don't know whether I should be gliding or flapping, <br />
I can't tell where the ground is, cos I'm high on Risperidone pills,<br />
And though your voice sounds heavy I feel real light, headed,<br />
Weigh myself down with these lead balloons so I sink to the surface,<br />
See, I'm trying to fly with my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds,<br />
I've been poking for a while to figure out where solid earth is,<br />
But when I tell you to brace yourself, for I will take us all into outer space,<br />
You ask me to stand next to Archimedes, between a rock and a hard place</p>

<p>Are you still hearing voices?<br />
See we can all fabricate beauty in a whole host of places,<br />
Like how the sun rises each day at just the perfect time, <br />
The unmatched natural wonder of bees in a hive,<br />
It sometimes baffles me how I can see new eyes,<br />
In a face that I've looked at a million times,<br />
Don't think I don't hear what you say about me, <br />
Don't think I can't read what you write about me, <br />
I'll scribble with invisible ink on transparent toilet paper, <br />
To leave your house looking like it got TP'd by a shy schoolboy who's afraid of committing visible sin<br />
If you've got daggers drawn, I won't hold mine in, </p>

<p>How is your appetite?<br />
I know they say I ought to be more careful around you,<br />
But know I can tiptoe and dig my heels in at the same time, <br />
See I've been walking around on eggshells on land mines, <br />
And I invite you to come closer but this field is mine,<br />
Now you might be inclined to erect a zip line, <br />
But can I advise instead that you go for a tight rope, <br />
Cos I assure you if you leave just one toe out of line,<br />
You might just fall into my reality.</p>
