                    <p>A <br />
billion lives.<br />
A deep black pit, <br />
A rising moon turned <br />
from sunshine, A whole? <br />
So clean. A perfect circle. A <br />
bottomless hole, inlined with <br />
peep hole to it's base. It's funny. <br />
From far away - that a painting is <br />
be made from just one non-color. <br />
It's funny that a painting can say all <br />
of nothing at the same time. A cross <br />
section of a lead pencil, expanded. A <br />
cylinder of charcoal pushed into belt <br />
sander, and then &not;cleaned diligently by <br />
an obsessive compulsive that enjoys<br />
giving you pretty things to look at. It's <br />
painted, clearly, but painted with a bul-<br />
bous droop. A soft rug to nestle your<br />
toes into. A surface made of what? A <br />
microscope? Zoomed in so far is not<br />
usually smooth. Deepest black with<br />
pores that catch the light. Up close <br />
you see eyes and resin, ant heads <br />
unwilling. A billion flies? Lucid <br />
wings, and glistening wet signs <br />
of life. A garbled communion<br />
Limbs with limbs. Huddled <br />
and warm on the pin of <br />
what is no more than <br />
a great black <br />
drop.</p>
