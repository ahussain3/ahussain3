                    <p>A butterfly sits on <br />
the surface of a blade<br />
of wheat, a breeze <br />
blows and presses <br />
his amber wings down to <br />
his sides, like massage <br />
hands pushing down <br />
on his spine, he flicks <br />
back up, he is unsteady, <br />
and steadies himself,<br />
he lets his wings dangle <br />
like wrinkled papyrus <br />
tied to fan blades, <br />
flickering and steady<br />
and flickering, and amber <br />
and black, he<br />
allows them to separate <br />
and rejoin, to flicker at <br />
the tips, and stay <br />
strong as gemstone, <br />
at the joints,<br />
he lifts and then replaces <br />
a foot and then the other,<br />
and steadies himself,<br />
the wind asks him to <br />
hold on a little tighter <br />
and prods him to <br />
move on, and he flicks his <br />
wings downwards and <br />
curls his tail to steady <br />
himself, the wind <br />
subsides, and then renews,<br />
his antlers stretch out <br />
in front of him and <br />
wobble, he considers <br />
leaving and foraging <br />
for food but decides to <br />
rest,<br />
