                    <p>In a city that has long since silenced its stars,<br />
At an hour usually monopolized by darkness, he stands alone,<br />
On the inside everything is softened by an orange light,<br />
An orange light that coerces dark shadows into dancing on his orange skin,<br />
An orange light that pulls his facial features out of blackness,<br />
This scene is borrowed from a Caravaggio masterpiece,<br />
But beyond its pristine rectangular frame, there is panic,<br />
The orange light flees the space as fast as is physically permissible and crashes with a dull thud onto generic grey city concrete,<br />
Take him to his seat, back rounded, shoulders relaxed, head down, elbows on knees, toes curled, his legs straddle the window of his 8th floor condo,<br />
His left hand waving frantically at the sirens below, desperately trying to attract their attention<br />
&quot;Sir! Can you hear me!&quot;, shouts the firefighter below, &quot;Please do not jump, help is on the way&quot;<br />
The hand that they do not see adds fuel to the flames that are engulfing his former dwelling place,<br />
He has chosen this window wisely, in plain sight and far enough from the fire escape,<br />
The ladder long enough will take 3 minutes to get here, the fire will take 4, just to be safe,<br />
Window frames are easy to sit in if you have a thick glove, a strong punch, and a high pain threshold,<br />
He was careful to pluck the shards from the around the sill.<br />
One eye returns to studying the flames, hoping to somehow capture their heat, their fervor, their elegance, their insatiable gluttony, the greed the fuels them to keep going, to take more and more,<br />
His other eye is still crying for attention,<br />
Demanding that more blankets be held at 4 corners,<br />
That more crowds refuse to leave while being turned away,<br />
That more pairs of eyes glow bright orange,<br />
and look up in wonder at the spectacle before them in way they should have done long ago,<br />
The smell of smoke fills both nostrils, a mere underpainting for the smell of satisfaction that will soon follow,<br />
The flames now trickle up his ankle, playing as they threaten to correct the skin,<br />
Inducing a searing pain that challenges even his disciplined threshold, pain that be achieved only with great care,<br />
Why?<br />
In a moment of clarity he realized,<br />
His hands were too soft<br />
The skin on his feet had not been sufficiently thickened,<br />
His soul was too easily scratched,<br />
The insides of his bones had never been cold and the inside of his skin had never been scorched,<br />
This show was just a recap, a chance to catch up for those who missed it the first time around,<br />
Catch up for all the childhood wounds he already knew how to avoid,<br />
All the childhood bones he already knew not to break,<br />
All childhood stoves he already knew not to touch,<br />
His skin, is still praying for scars,<br />
A plea for pain so grandiose and perfectly choreographed that to the untrained eye, it seems like a beautiful, unfortunate accident</p>
